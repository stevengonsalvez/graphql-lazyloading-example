# System Patterns: GraphQL Lazy Loading POC

## System Architecture

The application follows a classic client-server architecture with some specific patterns to enable lazy loading:

```
┌─────────────────────┐      ┌───────────────────────────┐
│                     │      │                           │
│   React Client      │      │   GraphQL Server          │
│   (Apollo Client)   │◄────►│   (GraphQL Yoga)          │
│                     │      │                           │
└─────────────────────┘      └───────────────────────────┘
       ▲                                    ▲
       │                                    │
       │                                    │

```

### Data Flow

1. Client sends GraphQL query with `@defer` and `@stream` directives
2. Server processes initial query and returns immediate fields
3. Client renders initial UI with available data
4. Server continues processing deferred/streamed fields
5. Server sends additional chunks as they become available
6. Client updates UI incrementally with new data

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. GraphQL Incremental Delivery

The project uses GraphQL's incremental delivery capabilities through:

- **@defer Directive**: For non-critical fields that can be sent later
- **@stream Directive**: For lists that can be sent one item at a time

This pattern allows for more efficient data delivery and improved perceived performance.

### 2. Artificial Delays

To simulate real-world network and processing delays, the project implements:

- Configurable delays in resolvers
- Different delay durations for different data types
- Progressive streaming with staggered delays

These artificial delays help demonstrate the benefits of lazy loading without requiring complex backend systems.

### 3. Mock Data Instead of Real APIs

The system uses generated mock data rather than real API calls to:
- Provide consistent, predictable behavior
- Allow for easy modification of data structures
- Eliminate external dependencies
- Simplify demonstration of the lazy loading patterns

### 4. Component-Based UI

The frontend architecture follows a component-based approach where:
- Each UI section handles its own data fetching and loading states
- Components can display partial data while waiting for the rest
- Loading indicators are contextual to specific data sections

## Design Patterns in Use

### 1. Progressive Disclosure Pattern

The UI reveals information progressively as it becomes available, following these principles:
- Essential information is shown first
- Details are loaded later or on demand
- User can interact with available information while waiting for the rest

### 2. Generator Functions for Streaming

Server resolvers use JavaScript generator functions to implement streaming behavior:

```typescript
async function* streamingResolver() {
  for (const item of items) {
    await delay(200); // Simulate processing time
    yield item;       // Send item to client
  }
}
```

This pattern allows for controlled, sequential delivery of list items.

### 3. Loading State Pattern

UI components implement a consistent loading state pattern:
- Skeleton placeholders for initial loading
- Inline loading indicators for deferred content
- Progressive appearance animations for streamed items

### 4. Expandable Detail Pattern

Content that requires detailed information implements:
- Initially loaded summary information
- User-triggered expansion that loads details
- Loading indicators during detail fetching

## Component Relationships

1. **Server Components**:
   - Schema (defines structure with defer/stream directives)
   - Resolvers (implements lazy loading logic)
   - Mock Data (provides realistic content)

2. **Client Components**:
   - Apollo Client (handles incremental data reception)
   - GraphQL Queries (declares defer/stream usage)
   - UI Components (renders and updates with partial data)
   - Loading States (provides feedback during incremental loading)
