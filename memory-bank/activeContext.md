# Active Context: GraphQL Lazy Loading POC

## Current Work Focus

The project is in the implementation phase with all core components developed. We have successfully built:

1. A GraphQL server with `@defer` and `@stream` directive support
2. A React client that consumes and renders incrementally loaded data
3. UI components that mimic the EE website design and demonstrate lazy loading
4. Documentation explaining the implementation patterns

The current focus is on fixing TypeScript configuration issues and refining the lazy loading behavior to ensure optimal user experience.

## Recent Changes

1. **GraphQL Schema Created**
   - Defined a schema modeling the EE website domains
   - Added `@defer` and `@stream` directives to appropriate fields
   - Created type definitions for all entities

2. **Server Implementation**
   - Built GraphQL Yoga server with defer/stream support
   - Fixed TypeScript configuration issues with the GraphQL Yoga setup
   - Added `@graphql-tools/schema` to properly create the executable schema
   - Implemented resolvers with artificial delays
   - Created mock data generators for all domains

3. **Client Implementation**
   - Set up Apollo Client with support for incremental delivery
   - Built UI components resembling the EE website
   - Implemented loading states for deferred and streamed content

4. **Documentation**
   - Created guides explaining the lazy loading patterns
   - Added comments explaining key implementation details
   - Prepared documentation on running and testing the application
   - Updated memory bank to reflect recent changes

## Next Steps

1. **Server Stabilization**
   - Verify that the GraphQL Yoga configuration works correctly with the new setup
   - Install any additional dependencies that might be needed
   - Test the server to ensure @defer and @stream directives work as expected

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with various network conditions to validate lazy loading benefits
   - Measure and optimize initial load time vs. full load time
   - Verify UI responsiveness during incremental loading

3. **UI Refinements**
   - Enhance loading state visualizations
   - Add more transitions for newly loaded content
   - Ensure consistent behavior across all components

4. **Deployment**
   - Finalize Docker setup for production deployment
   - Create deployment documentation
   - Add monitoring for performance metrics

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **GraphQL Yoga Configuration**
   - Updated to use `makeExecutableSchema` from `@graphql-tools/schema`
   - Using proper Yoga schema configuration instead of direct typeDefs usage
   - This approach is more type-safe and aligns with latest GraphQL Yoga patterns

2. **Loading Indicator Approach**
   - Currently using a mix of skeleton loading and spinner indicators
   - Considering more subtle loading indicators for streamed lists
   - Evaluating whether to add progress indicators for long-running defer operations

3. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Need to determine how to handle partially failed queries
   - Considering how to display errors for specific deferred fields
   - Evaluating retry strategies for failed deferred/streamed portions

4. **Caching Strategy**
   - Currently using Apollo's default in-memory cache
   - Considering how to handle cache updates for streamed data
   - Evaluating persistence options for offline support
