# Active Context: GraphQL Lazy Loading POC

## Current Work Focus

The project is in the implementation phase with a focus on fixing directive-related issues. We have:

1. Updated the GraphQL schema to correctly define `@defer` and `@stream` directives
2. Modified the server configuration to properly support these directives
3. Updated the client queries to match the new schema format
4. Adjusted documentation to reflect these important changes

The current focus is on getting the server running correctly and ensuring all the lazy loading features work as expected.

## Recent Changes

1. **GraphQL Schema Updated**
   - Fixed directive definitions to use proper locations:
     - `@defer` on FRAGMENT_SPREAD | INLINE_FRAGMENT
     - `@stream` on FIELD
   - Removed directives from FIELD_DEFINITION locations
   - Preserved the same data structure and relationships

2. **Server Configuration Fixed**
   - Switched from `makeExecutableSchema` to GraphQL Yoga's `createSchema` function
   - This natively supports `@defer` and `@stream` directives
   - Updated server configuration to match GraphQL Yoga v5 requirements

3. **Client Queries Updated**
   - Modified queries to use directives in the correct locations
   - Updated `@defer` to be used on inline fragments instead of fields
   - Adjusted `@stream` to be used on field selections

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated memory bank to reflect these critical changes
   - Added information about directive usage in GraphQL
   - Documented the proper way to configure GraphQL Yoga for incremental delivery

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Server Operation**
   - Test the server with updated schema and directives
   - Ensure GraphiQL works and can execute queries
   - Verify that `@defer` and `@stream` directives are properly recognized

2. **Test Client Integration**
   - Update client if needed to match server changes
   - Test incremental data loading with updated queries
   - Verify that UI still correctly handles progressive loading

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with various network conditions to validate lazy loading benefits
   - Measure and optimize initial load time vs. full load time
   - Verify UI responsiveness during incremental loading

4. **Documentation Completion**
   - Add specifics about directive usage in GraphQL
   - Update diagrams to reflect correct implementation
   - Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **GraphQL Directive Usage**
   - `@defer` must be used on FRAGMENT_SPREAD or INLINE_FRAGMENT, not directly on fields
   - `@stream` must be used on FIELD selections, not on field definitions
   - This aligns with the GraphQL spec and GraphQL Yoga implementation

2. **GraphQL Server Configuration**
   - Using GraphQL Yoga's `createSchema` instead of `makeExecutableSchema`
   - This approach has built-in support for incremental delivery directives
   - Follows the recommended pattern for GraphQL Yoga v5

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Need to test each directive type separately to ensure proper behavior
   - Should verify network activity shows incremental response chunks
   - Check that client correctly processes and renders incremental data

4. **Progressive Enhancement Strategy**
   - Continue with the same UI approach for loading indicators
   - Ensure client code correctly handles the updated query structure
   - Maintain the same user experience despite schema changes
