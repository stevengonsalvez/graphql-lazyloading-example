# Progress: GraphQL Lazy Loading POC

## What Works

### Server-side
✅ **GraphQL Schema**
- Complete schema with domains modeling the EE website
- `@defer` and `@stream` directives applied to appropriate fields
- Type definitions for all entities

✅ **GraphQL Server**
- GraphQL Yoga server running with incremental delivery support
- GraphiQL interface for testing queries
- CORS enabled for client communication

✅ **Resolvers**
- Implemented resolvers for all query fields
- Added artificial delays to simulate network/processing time
- Created generator functions for streamed lists

✅ **Mock Data**
- Generated realistic mock data for all domains
- Created data relationships that match the EE website structure
- Implemented helper functions for data generation and delay simulation

### Client-side
✅ **Apollo Client Setup**
- Configured Apollo Client for incremental delivery
- Set up proper cache policies
- Implemented query definitions with defer/stream directives

✅ **React Components**
- Created all UI components matching the EE screenshot
- Implemented responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Built header, footer, and main content sections

✅ **Loading States**
- Implemented skeleton loading for initial states
- Created loading indicators for deferred content
- Added streaming indicators for list items

✅ **User Interactions**
- Implemented expandable sections with deferred loading
- Created interactive elements matching the EE website
- Built responsive navigation components

### Documentation
✅ **Project Setup**
- Created README with project overview
- Added setup instructions for local development
- Included Docker configuration for easy startup

✅ **GraphQL Documentation**
- Documented schema structure and directive usage
- Created examples of queries with defer/stream
- Added explanations of resolver implementations

✅ **Memory Bank**
- Set up memory bank structure with core files
- Documented project brief and context
- Captured technical decisions and patterns

## What's Left to Build

### Server-side
⏳ **Advanced Error Handling**
- Implement specialized error handling for failed deferred operations
- Create error boundaries for streamed data
- Add error recovery mechanisms

⏳ **Performance Optimizations**
- Fine-tune artificial delays for better demonstration
- Add configurable delay settings
- Optimize resolver execution

### Client-side
⏳ **Loading Animation Refinements**
- Enhance transitions for newly loaded content
- Improve visual feedback during long operations
- Add more subtle loading indicators

⏳ **Additional Interaction Patterns**
- Implement "load more" pattern with streaming
- Add pull-to-refresh with partial updates
- Create interactive demo controls for adjusting loading behavior

### Documentation
⏳ **Advanced Usage Guide**
- Document more complex lazy loading patterns
- Add performance comparison metrics
- Create animated diagrams of data flow

⏳ **Video Demonstration**
- Record a screencast showing lazy loading in action
- Add narration explaining the benefits
- Compare with traditional loading approaches

## Current Status

The project is in a functional state with all core features implemented. The application successfully demonstrates GraphQL lazy loading with both `@defer` and `@stream` directives.

The server and client communicate properly, with incremental data loading visible through the UI components. All sections of the EE website mockup are implemented with appropriate loading states.

The codebase is well-structured and documented, making it easy to understand and extend. Docker configuration is in place for both development and production environments.

## Known Issues

1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Some older browsers may not fully support incremental delivery
   - Need to add graceful degradation for unsupported browsers

2. **Type Safety Gaps**
   - TypeScript types for deferred fields could be improved
   - Some any-typed objects in resolver implementations

3. **UI Inconsistencies**
   - Loading indicator styles vary slightly between components
   - Some animations could be smoother during transitions

4. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Need more detailed explanation of Apollo Client configuration
   - Missing troubleshooting section for common issues
